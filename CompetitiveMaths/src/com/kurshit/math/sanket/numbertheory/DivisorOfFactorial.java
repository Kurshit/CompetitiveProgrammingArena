 * Solution Source : https://unacademy.com/class/sieve-of-eratosthenes/6U2QS42H
 * 
 * Statement : Given a number N, count the total number of divisors of N!
 * 
 * Example : 
 * 		N = 3
 * 
 * 		Output: 6 
 * 
 * 	3! = 4, 6 has following divisors - 1, 6, 2, 3
 * 
 * Constraints : 
 * 
 *  1 <= T <= 500
 *  0 <= N <= 50000  // 5 X 10^4
